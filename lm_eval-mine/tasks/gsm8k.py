"Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems"
https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168

State-of-the-art language models can match human performance on many tasks, but
they still struggle to robustly perform multi-step mathematical reasoning. To
diagnose the failures of current models and support research, we introduce GSM8K,
a dataset of 8.5K high quality linguistically diverse grade school math word problems.
We find that even the largest transformer models fail to achieve high test performance,
despite the conceptual simplicity of this problem distribution.

NOTE: See the official implementation of the task:
    https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math/blob/master/grade_school_math/calculator.py
for how to make use of the dataset's calculator annotations in your language
model's sample/generation function.
