Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  I am facing a new situation today: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had "

The beetle has two wires, one is red, and the other one is black. You should ask a grown-up to help you take off the black wire. This will make the car safe to work on!\\nNext, you'll need a tool called a screwdriver to remove a small round thing called the rim around the headlight. Once that's done, you can carefully pull out the whole headlight like a puzzle piece. And that's how you remove the beetle headlights!\"}\n{\"text\": \"System: You are"

He invented a special train that was pushed along by air and in 1893 he invented something like a zip  that could be used to open and close clothes. It could be used on men's trousers and on ladies' dresses. He did not call his invention a 'zip' but everybody says that he was the 'Father of the Zip'. Mr. Judson tried to sell his invention but no one wanted it because it did not work very well. A Canadian changed Mr. Judson's invention and made it better. He made a zip that worked very well in 1913.This is the same zip we use today. Question: Mr. Whitcomb Judson invented   _   in 1893.
