Local authorities have charged the suspect with murder and attempted murder in connection with the horrific crime. In this article, we delve into the chilling incident, the suspect, and the impact it has had on the community.\nThe Incident\nThe alarming event took place at a popular restaurant in Sydney, Australia. A woman and her date were enjoying their meal – blissfully unaware of the tragic circumstances that would soon unfold. As they shared conversation and indulged in their dinner, a man approached the couple and, without warning, began to stab them with a sharp object.\nPatrons at the restaurant scrambled for safety, as the assailant continued his violent rampage. Bystanders quickly called emergency services, who promptly arrived at the scene. Although both victims were rushed to a nearby hospital, the woman succumbed to her injuries. The man she was on a date with remained in critical condition, fighting for his life.\nThe Suspect\nInitial investigations revealed that the alleged attacker had no known connections to the victims – adding to the mystifying nature of this sudden and brutal assault. Witnesses reported that the assailant seemed to have no specific motive and appeared to carry out the act senselessly.\nFollowing a thorough investigation, local police identified and arrested the suspect. During the process, it was discovered that the alleged attacker had a history of criminal behavior and a troubled past, though it is unclear if this played a role in the tragic incident.\nAuthorities have formally charged the man with murder and attempted murder in connection with the heinous crime. He awaits a hearing to determine a trial date and, if convicted, could face a life sentence in prison.\nThe Community's Response\nThe shocking nature of the crime has left the residents of Sydney reeling, as they struggle to come to terms with the harrowing event. The restaurant where the attack occurred has since been closed, with a makeshift memorial being created outside to commemorate the victims.\nMany have questioned how such a vicious crime could happen in what is considered to be one of the safest cities in the world. This tragic event has spurred local officials to reassess current security measures and devise strategies to reinforce public safety. Additionally, discussions surrounding mental health and criminal rehabilitation have surfaced as residents seek to comprehend the actions of the alleged perpetrator and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\nIn the wake of the stabbing, the community has banded together with an outpouring of grief and support for the victims and their families. Candlelight vigils have been held, and an online fundraising campaign is underway to assist the surviving victim with his medical expenses and recovery.\nConclusion\nThe tragic attack in Sydney serves as a chilling reminder that senseless acts of violence can happen anywhere and at any time. The community's response to this horrific and seemingly random act of brutality has been one of solidarity and determination to prevent such incidents in the future. As the case unfolds, the victims and their families remain in the hearts of the community, who are grieving the devastating loss of a life cut tragically short and supporting the recovering victim as he continues to endure this unimaginable ordeal."}
{"text": "User: Q:I read this background article the other day: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  I am facing a new situation today: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which lake had fewer dissolved nutrients?\nA:\n\nAssistant: The lake with fewer dissolved nutrients would be High lake. This is because it had layers of stratified water, which acts as a barrier to nutrient mixing. As a result, it was poor in nutrients."}

While determining where to place spaces, I'll be guided by the rules of the English language, as well as presumptions about the format of addresses, company names, dates, and technical/legal notes.\n1. Breaking down company details:\nFirst, I'm going to separate individual words and details related to the company and address. \n- \"ifmelectronicgmbh\": This appears to be a company name, which should be \"ifm electronic gmbh\".\n- \"•Friedrichstraße1•45128Essen\": This seems to be a street address in Germany (Friedrichstraße 1, 45128 Essen).\n- The bullet character (•) can be considered as a separator.\nAfter making these changes, the phrase so far is: \"ifm electronic gmbh • Friedrichstraße 1 • 45128 Essen\".\n2. Handling reservation clause:\nNext, I notice the segment of text starting with \"Wereservetherighttomaketechnicalalterationswithoutpriornotice.\" This appears to be a standard non-liability clause. Let's break it down:\n- \"Wereservetherighttomaketechnicalalterationswithoutpriornotice\": This can be separated into \"We reserve the right to make technical alterations without prior notice.\"\nAfter adding these modifications, the sentence so far becomes \"ifm electronic gmbh • Friedrichstraße 1 • 45128 Essen - We reserve the right to make technical alterations without prior notice.\"\n3. Identifying product details and date:\nTo wrap up, I'll divide the final details which seem to be related to a product model number and the date:\n- \"—GB—SV5200—03.06.2015\": Here, I can establish that \"GB\" and \"SV5200\" are likely separate entities (looks like product identifiers or codes), and \"03.06.2015\" is probably a date.\nTherefore, this segment becomes: \"- GB - SV5200 - 03.06.2015.\"\nSo, the final version of the separated text is: \"ifm electronic gmbh • Friedrichstraße 1 • 45128 Essen - We reserve the right to make technical alterations without prior notice. - GB - SV5200 - 03.06.2015.\"\nThis step-wise breakdown splits the original text into more readable sentences and phrases while maintaining their meanings and serving the reader's clarity."}

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps.\n\nUser: Write some highlights for the following article:\nThe historic six-month agreement over Tehran's nuclear program may begin a new era of relations with Iran, but it will be a long road back for the country's most vital sector, oil. Iran produces about two and half million barrels a day -- far off its 4-million-barrel-per-day peak a decade ago.  Output is hovering at a level last seen at the end of Iran's war with Iraq. With North Sea Brent crude averaging over $100 a barrel for a record three years running, the sanctions on energy alone are costing Tehran about $50 billion in lost annual revenue. Despite the deal breakthrough, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said most of the sanctions will stick as the world gauges the intentions of this relatively new administration in Tehran. \"During the six month phase, the oil sanctions that will remain in place will continue to cause over $25 billion in lost revenues to Iran or over $4 billion a month,\" he said. The message is clear:  the pressure remains, but if all goes well, in a half year's time Iran can expect more in return for transparency. The last few years have been filled with uncertainty. Tensions around the Strait of Hormuz with the on-and-off threats by the previous government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to block oil shipments in the Gulf have kept what strategists call a 10-15% risk premium on global energy prices. Iran sits on about 9% of the world's proven oil reserves, claiming a few years back that it has nearly 150 billion barrels and the world's largest gas field. But its top four customers --China, India, Japan and South Korea -- have all had to cut back their energy imports by a third or more in the past few years due to U.S. and European pressure. With every year that has passed, the screws have been tightened by Washington and the countries of the European Union.  It was not only sanctions against oil, but also blocking Iran's ability to secure shipping insurance and to trade in U.S. dollars and euros.  That economic isolation, many Middle East strategists I have spoken with suggest, is what brought Iran's new government to the negotiating table. In 2012, the Iranian rial plunged by up to 80%.  Basic staples of life, poultry and bread skyrocketed in price and the economy went through a period of hyper-inflation. With rising import prices due to a plummeting currency, industrial Iran is no longer able to compete.  There are reports that the state manufacturing sector had laid off up to 800,000 workers in 2012 and those who have kept their jobs saw their wages eroded by skyrocketing prices. Oil executives with experience in the country say this initial agreement would help lift a cloud of uncertainty over the oil market, but that President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet have to establish much better contract terms if this honeymoon period lifts sanctions. The blunt-speaking Chief Executive of French energy group Total, Christophe de Margerie, told me at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi this month that Iran needs to try and create a better climate for investment if this weekend's breakthrough is sustained. \"I can tell you with the experience we have from Iran it doesn't always bring as we say in French partie de plaisir ... a win-win.\" Oil giant Saudi Arabia has expressed doubts about signing a deal with Tehran, which will introduce more challenges within OPEC.  Iraq plans to double production by 2020 to six million barrels a day and with Iran wanting to rebuild exports, the Kingdom may have trim its own production to defend prices. It is still early days, but this country of nearly 80 million people has been described as potentially being the Germany of the Middle East with plenty of natural resources -- that is, if it can emerge from years of economic isolation.\nHighlights:\n\nAssistant: 1. Historic six-month agreement over Tehran's nuclear program presents an opportunity for Iran's oil sector recovery, but the journey will be long and difficult.\n2. Iran's oil production is currently around 2.5 million barrels per day, significantly less than its peak of 4 million barrels per day a decade ago.\n3. Sanctions on energy alone are costing Tehran approximately $50 billion in lost annual revenue.\n4. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said most sanctions will remain in place during the six-month phase, causing Iran to lose over $25 billion in revenues.\n5. Iran's top four oil customers, China, India, Japan, and South Korea, have had to cut back their imports by a third or more due to U.S. and European pressure.\n6. Iran's economy suffered greatly during the period of sanctions, with rampant inflation and industrial layoffs.\n7. Establishing better contract terms is crucial for Iran to lift sanctions and improve the investment climate.\n8. Oil giant Saudi Arabia has doubts about signing a deal with Tehran, introducing challenges within OPEC for Iran's oil output growth."}

Gerard Brantsen was one of the Dutch signatories to the treaty ending a war that began in what year?\nThe answer to this question is:\n\nAssistant: To answer this complex question, we must first examine the historical figure Gerard Brantsen and identify which war was ended with the treaty he signed. \nGerard Brantsen (1735-1809) was a Dutch diplomat and politician in the 18th-19th century. His most significant contribution was to the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which marked the end of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War.\nThe Fourth Anglo-Dutch War was a conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, and commenced on December 20, 1780. The war was primarily driven by commercial rivalries and political tensions that emerged from the American Revolutionary War. At this time, the Dutch Republic, in an attempt to protect their trade interests, sought to provide military assistance and resources to the newly established United States of America. This support of the rebellious colonies angered Great Britain and consequently led to the escalation of hostilities between the two European powers.\nThe Treaty of Paris, which ended the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, was signed on September 3, 1783. The negotiations brought together the major powers involved in the American Revolutionary War. Delegates from the United States, France, Spain, and the Dutch Republic were present to deliberate the terms for reestablishing diplomatic relations and resolving territorial disputes. Gerard Brantsen, acting as one of the Dutch envoys, played a significant role in the negotiation process.\nIn conclusion, Gerard Brantsen was one of the Dutch signatories to the Treaty of Paris, which terminated the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. This war began on December 20, 1780."}

You must generate a detailed and long answer.\n\nUser: In Christianity, an archbishop (, via Latin \"archiepiscopus\", from Greek , from -, \"chief\", and , \"bishop\") is a bishop of higher rank or office. In some cases, like the Lutheran Church of Sweden, it is the denomination leader title. Like popes, patriarchs, metropolitans, cardinal bishops, diocesan bishops, and suffragan bishops, archbishops are in the highest of the three traditional orders of bishops, priests, also called presbyters, and deacons. An archbishop may be granted the title, or ordained as chief pastor of a metropolitan see or another episcopal see to which the title of archbishop is attached. \nEpiscopal sees are generally arranged in groups in which the bishop who is the ordinary of one of them has certain powers and duties of oversight over the other sees. He is known as the metropolitan archbishop of that see. In the Roman Catholic Church, canon 436 of the Code of Canon Law indicates what these powers and duties are for a Latin Rite metropolitan archbishop, while those of the head of an autonomous (\"sui iuris\") Eastern Catholic Church are indicated in canon 157 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. \nAs well as the much more numerous metropolitan sees, there are 77 Roman Catholic sees that have archiepiscopal rank. In some cases, such a see is the only one in a country, such as Luxembourg or Monaco, too small to be divided into several dioceses so as to form an ecclesiastical province. In others, the title of archdiocese is for historical reasons attributed to a see that was once of greater importance.\n1. What is the highest of the bishops?\n2. What religion has a see?\n3.

The highest of the bishops are archbishops, who hold a higher rank or office compared to other bishops in the hierarchy.\n2. Christianity, and more specifically, the Catholic Church has a \"see\" or a diocese, which is the jurisdiction of a bishop.\n3. There are 77 Roman Catholic sees that have archiepiscopal rank.\n4. Luxembourg is one country where there is only one see.\n5. Another country with only one see is Monaco.\n6. There is only one see in these countries because they are too small to be divided into several dioceses so as to form an ecclesiastical province.\n7.

His victories include an unequalled eleven Grand Tours (five Tours of France, five Tours of Italy, and a Tour of Spain), all of the five Monuments, three World Championships, the hour record, every major one-day race other than Paris-Tours, and extensive victories on the track. Born in Meensel-Kiezegem, Brabant, Belgium, he grew up in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre where his parents ran a grocery store. He played several sports, but found his true passion in cycling.\nMerckx opened the 1967 campaign with two stage victories at the Giro di Sardegna. He followed these successes by entering Paris-Nice where he won the second stage and took the race lead. Two stages later, a teammate, Tom Simpson, attacked with several other riders on a climb and was nearly 20 minutes ahead of Merckx, who remained in a group behind. Merckx attacked two days later on a climb 70 km into the stage. He was able to establish a firm advantage, but obeyed orders from his manager to wait for the chasing Simpson. Merckx won the stage, while Simpson secured his overall victory.  On 18 March, Merckx started the Milan-San Remo and was seen as a 120-1 favorite to win the race. He attacked on the Capo Berta and again on the Poggio, leaving only Gianni Motta with him. The two slowed their pace and were joined by two more riders. Merckx won the four-man sprint to the finish. His next victory came in La Fleche Wallonne after he missed out on an early break, caught up to it, and attacked from it to win the race. On 20 May, he started the Giro d'Italia, his first Grand Tour. He won the twelfth and fourteenth stages en route to finishing ninth in the general classification.  He signed with Faema on 2 September for ten years worth 400,000 Belgian francs. He chose to switch over in order to be in complete control over the team he was racing for. In addition, he would not have to pay for various expenses that came with racing such as wheels and tires. The next day, Merckx started the men's road race at the 1967 UCI Road World Championships in Heerlen, Netherlands. The course consisted of ten laps of a circuit. Motta attacked on the first lap and was joined by Merckx and five other riders. The group thinned to five as they reached the finish line where Merckx was able to out-sprint Jan Janssen for first place. In doing so, he became the third rider to win the world road race amateur and professional titles. By winning the race he earned the right to wear the rainbow jersey as world champion. Answer this question using a quote from the following article:\nDid he have any other victories?\n\nAssistant: Eddy Merckx had an impressive number of victories throughout his career. As mentioned in the original text, his wins include eleven Grand Tours, five Monuments, three World Championships, the hour record, and almost every major one-day race with the exception of Paris-Tours. Furthermore, he achieved numerous victories on the track. His incredible success has earned him the reputation of being the most successful cyclist in the history of competitive cycling, which clearly demonstrates the extent of his additional victories beyond the ones specifically discussed in the text."}

Franklin's attempts to work alone prove disastrous such as a failed diplomatic mission to the King that pushes the colonies to open armed revolt.They finally reconcile in 1776 when Franklin begs Amos to return and agrees to sign a contract drafted by the mouse for more considerate treatment. Furthermore, as Franklin examines the agreement, Thomas Jefferson arrives to ask for help for the beginning of the Declaration of Independence he is writing.

Zeko\nThe answer to this question is:\n\nAssistant: Title: The Bloodline of Zeko\nGenre: Action, Mystery, Adventure\nPlot:\nIn the bustling city of Veloria, a new generation of a once-powerful crime family is seeking to rise to power. As members of the criminal underworld scramble to establish their dominance, a simple yet mysterious question echoes through the ranks: Who does the dagger belong to?\nThe film begins with our protagonist, Luna, an ambitious and clever journalist who inherited the same resolve from her mother - a prominent crime reporter that vanished without a trace several years ago. After receiving an anonymous tip about the Zeko criminal empire, she decides to pursue the story in search of her mother's whereabouts and delve into the dark world of organized crime.\nAs Luna delves deeper into her investigation and gradually gains the trust of the Zeko family members, she unexpectedly uncovers the legendary \"Blood Dagger of Zeko\" - a priceless artifact that once belonged to the family's powerful and ruthless patriarch, Zeko the Elder. Left in his will, the dagger was known to grant immense power and authority to whoever it ultimately belonged to, becoming the key to the family's fortune and the city's criminal empire.\nHowever, an internal power struggle within the family begins to escalate when the youngest and most ambitious sibling, Adrian Zeko, sets his eyes on the dagger. As the other siblings, Rina and Niko, frantically search for clues to secure their own claim, a race against time ensues to determine the heir to the Zeko empire.\nLuna becomes entwined in this dangerous game as she uncovers links between the dagger, the family, and her mother's disappearance. As the story unfolds, it is revealed that Luna's mother had discovered the truth about the dagger and had intended to expose the family's secrets and transgressions before her sudden disappearance. Unable to overlook the pervasive corruption any longer, Luna decides to take matters into her own hands to honor her mother's legacy and to bring down the Zeko empire.\nIn a thrilling conclusion, Luna confronts Adrian, who is on the verge of obtaining the dagger. Amidst the chaos, Luna reveals her findings, causing a shift in power dynamics. The siblings ultimately unite to dismantle the family's criminal activities and restore justice to Veloria.\nThe film ends with Luna, finally honoring her mother's memory as an esteemed crime reporter, taking ownership of the dagger and gifting it to a museum for the citizens of Veloria to witness the tale of the once-powerful Zeko family dynasty.\nThe answer to the question \"Who does the dagger belong to?\" is ultimately revealed to signify the triumph of truth, justice, and morality over a dark and corrupted past. Luna's brave pursuit for her mother's legacy results in the downfall of the Zeko family, and the dagger finally belongs to the people of Veloria in a symbolic gesture of hope and redemption."}

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1993, the Breeders released their second album, Last Splash. At this time, the group's lineup  consisted of sisters Kim and Kelley Deal on guitar and vocals, Josephine Wiggs on bass and vocals, and Jim Macpherson on drums. Last Splash was successful in various countries worldwide, and the group toured extensively and played at Lollapalooza 1994. In November 1994, Kelley Deal was arrested on drug-related charges, and in 1995, Wiggs left to pursue other musical projects. Macpherson continued playing with Kim Deal in her side-project group, the Amps, and then in the 1996 incarnation of the Breeders, but quit the band in 1997. The Breeders' lineups for their albums Title TK (2002) and Mountain Battles (2008) included the Deal sisters, Mando Lopez, and Jose Medeles. In 2013, Wiggs and Macpherson rejoined the Deals to tour the 20th anniversary of Last Splash—the LSXX Tour.On December 31, 2013, the Breeders performed their final concert on the 60-date tour in Austin, Texas. The group enjoyed the LSXX concerts, and decided they would like to record new music together. Throughout 2014, Wiggs traveled from her home in Brooklyn, New York to Dayton, Ohio, near where Macpherson and both Deals lived. The group began practicing new material in Kim Deal's basement, including compositions by her and one by Wiggs. By August, there were three new songs they could play well, two less so, and others they had not yet practiced. Reported titles were \"Skinhead #2\", \"Simone\", \"All Nerve\", and \"Launched\". The band Neutral Milk Hotel asked the Breeders to open for them at a Hollywood Bowl concert to be held on September 18. The latter decided to go on tour leading up to this show and to perform some new compositions in preparation for their eventual recording.\nThe answer to this question is:\n\nAssistant: The album released in 2002 by the Breeders, the band that played at Lollapalooza in 1994, was \"Title TK\". \nThis information was identified by carefully reading the provided context and extracting key pieces of information. The context mentions that the Breeders played at Lollapalooza in 1994. It also separately points out that one of their albums, \"Title TK\", was released in 2002.

You must generate a detailed and long answer.\n\nUser: Summarize this article:\nPhoto: AP \n  \n Donald Trump has announced that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will serve as chairman of his transition team, identifying personnel who would become part of a Trump White House. Christie will be working closely with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose father he sent to prison. \n  \n Just months ago, Trump accused Christie of having committed a federal crime in covering up the Bridgegate scandal. Now, NBC News reports, Christie will bring “substance” and “seriousness” to the Trump campaign: \n  \n Sources familiar with the planning say the transition team appointment shows “the role the governor is playing as the serious person around Trump who is trying to provide some discipline” to his growing organization. \n  \n Christie also continues to act as “a conduit between the establishment and Trump” based on Christie’s relationships with Republican elected officials across the country, sources said. \n  \n The New York Times reported last week that Kushner—Trump’s son-in-law and a real estate heir in his own right—would be a part of the very forward-looking transition team. (President Obama didn’t announce his Transition Team Chariman until the day after he won the 2008 election.) In 2005, as U.S. Attorney for the state of New Jersey, Christie successfully prosecuted Kushner’s father, Charles, for “crimes of greed, power, and excess.” \n  \n There does not seem to be any bad blood between Christie and Jared Kushner, however: In November, New Jersey awarded $93 million in tax breaks to a Kushner Companies high-rise in Jersey City. \n  \n Asked why the Trump campaign was directing press inquiries about the transition committee to the governor’s office, a spokeswoman for Christie told Gawker, “We’re trying to figure that out ourselves.” ||||| If Christie is truly heading Trump’s day-to-day transition effort, the answer to both questions has to be no, said Max Stier, who is chairman of the Partnership for Public Service and has been advising the campaigns on transition planning. “If Christie is going to really run the transition process, he can’t effectively be active in the campaign or be himself a candidate because it’s a full-time job,” Stier said. In 2012, Mitt Romney tapped former Utah Governor Mike Leavitt to run his transition, and Leavitt kept his distance from the campaign while building out what he called a 600-person “government in miniature.” It’s not clear if Trump plans a similar operation. If Christie’s role atop the transition team was more ceremonial, it might be possible for him to split time with the campaign, to stay in contention to be Trump’s running mate—or even to do the job he was elected to perform, governing the state of New Jersey. \n  \n The announcement came just a few days after The New York Times reported that Trump had asked his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to head up the transition efforts. Kushner was not mentioned in the press release announcing Christie’s new job. If Monday was an early indication, Christie seems to be operating pretty independently from the campaign: A Trump spokeswoman directed questions about his role to Christie’s gubernatorial office, which promptly referred those queries back to Trump’s campaign. \n  \n Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has not publicly announced a transition chief. And the fact that Trump made his own announcement so quickly is at least a momentary relief to those who wondered how seriously he would take the process. “First and foremost, it is really important that Trump has publicly named a transition chairman,” Stier said. “Trump is demonstrating his understanding that he needs to prepare for the possibility that he will be governing at the same time as he is trying to win the campaign.” \n  \n We want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com. |||||\n\nAssistant: Donald Trump has selected New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to serve as chairman of his transition team, which means he will be tasked with identifying personnel to become part of a Trump White House.

Five double-digit seeded teams have won games with four games remaining in the second round. \n  \n Even without a particularly mad March, the odds of picking all 63 games correctly are long. The chances of doing so was tabulated by a DePaul University math professor to be one-in-9.2 quintillion. \n  \n The prospect of someone taking home the billion dollar prize took a big hit after the very first game of the tournament.

(Associated Press) \n  \n A second day of upsets ended any chance of someone having a perfect NCAA tournament bracket in Warren Buffet's $1 billion challenge. It was a favorite that provided the first blemish on the final three people's brackets in the Quicken Loans contest on the Yahoo Sports website. \n  \n All three had ninth-seeded George Washington beating Memphis. The Tigers won 71-66. \n  \n \"If Warren Buffett wants to donate the (billion) to our university, we will take it and use it in good company,\" Memphis coach Josh Pastner said. \"We'll find a way.\" \n  \n It only took 25 games for everyone to be eliminated. Then again most of brackets were knocked out on the tournament's first full day. The number of unblemished brackets kept dwindling after third-seed Duke, sixth-seed UMass and seventh-seed New Mexico lost Friday. \n  \n Only 16 people remained perfect after 10th-seeded Stanford topped New Mexico. Then Tennessee routed UMass, leaving only six people with a chance of beating the 9.2 quintillion-to-1 odds. \n  \n Gonzaga's victory over Oklahoma State cut that down to the final three. \n  \n Even though no one won the $1 billion, the top 20 scores will still each get $100,000. \n  \n Quicken Loans, which is sponsoring and insuring the Buffet contest, said on its Twitter feed that it wouldn't reveal the number of entrants to the challenge. The pool was supposed to be capped at 15 million entries. It probably wouldn't have mattered if they had let more people join. \n  \n At CBSSports.com, only 0.03 percent of entrants were still perfect after Mercer upset Duke. They didn't last much longer as Tennessee's rout of UMass wiped out all the remaining unblemished entries. It took 21 games to end everyone's hope of perfection this year. Last season it took 23 games and 24 in 2012. \n  \n A year ago, not a single person of the 11 million who entered on ESPN's website was perfect after a first day filled with upsets. Just four got 15 out of 16 right. \n  \n This year people lasted a little longer. After 28 games, all 11 million entries had at least one mistake. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Follow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg |||||\nWrite a summary.\n\nAssistant: In 2014, the billion-dollar bracket dream for the NCAA tournament ended just 25 games into the competition.

Children are expected to wear their uniforms this term.As is usual at this time of the year,mornings at the school are quite cold and l would suggest children wear their sweaters to school.As the temperature goes up during the day,children tend to take off their outer clothes,so it is important that all sweatshirts are labeled . I have received a few requests from parents asking if their children can wear summer uniforms this term.I am of the view that all children in the school should follow the school policy and be dressed in the appropriate uniforms.In the longer term,a number of US at school have questioned the need to have a winter and summer uniform.Perhaps.with careful consideration,we can develop a uniform that will serve children for the whole academic year. As the foggy mornings start to appear,a number of parents have raised concerns over the safety of those children who walk to school.  Our dark green uniforms are not particularly visible to motorists.Hopefully, the \"Uniform Committee\" to be set up this term will deal with this particular issue.I will keep parents informed of the channels through which views may be expressed in future newsletters.

The three alarms I never use (high tones) because of my hearing loss. Although they claim water resistant I don't take it in the water. One did leak on me once but after it dried out it continued to work. Less than $50.00 including tax and shipping. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?\nAnswer:\n\nAssistant: The product review conveys a predominantly positive sentiment towards the G-shock watch. The reviewer shares their long-term experience with the product, stating that this is their third G-shock over a period of 25 years, which implies a sense of loyalty and satisfaction with the brand. Additionally, the reviewer mentions the watch's durability, as the first two watches never stopped running and the battery life can last 4-5 years if the light feature button is not used frequently. The watch's design and rounded appearance are also considered as appealing for an everyday watch.\nHowever, there are a few negative remarks mentioned as well. The reviewer notes that the rubber/plastic casing tends to get damaged, and the band needs to be replaced after years of heavy use. Furthermore, they reveal their disappointment in the watch's alarm feature, as the high tones cannot be heard due to their hearing loss. Lastly, the reviewer shares a concern related to water resistance, recounting an incident when the watch leaked, but acknowledges it continued working after drying out.\nOverall, the sentiment of the review is positive, as the user appears to be content with the watch's performance and design while acknowledging a few flaws. The fact that the reviewer continues to purchase G-shock watches after 25 years is a strong indication of their satisfaction with the product."}
{"text": "System: You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.\n\nUser: Write some highlights for the following article:\nManned by a pair of trained officers, a large private security jeep moves slowly past the high walls lining a residential street in the suburbs of Johannesburg, South Africa. Heavily armed and alert, the officers scan the designated area, looking for any suspicious activity. They work for CSS Tactical, a private security company hired by local residents to patrol their area and protect them from any potential criminals. \"To be proactive, we need to be noticed,\" says Ricky Croock, managing director of CSS Tactical. \"We need people to say 'hold on, there is a dedicated tactical vehicle.' \"A tactical vehicle is a bigger vehicle -- it is more aggressive, it's a deterrent. So the first point is we want to deter as opposed to catch crime.\" The security officers are well armed. They carry semi-automatic weapons and hand guns and they're trained in how and when to use them. And while only the police have the power of random stop and search in public places, security companies also stop people they regard as suspicious. From April 2011 to March 2012 there were 15,609 murders in South Africa, as well as 64,514 sexual offenses and 101,203 cases of aggravated robbery. According to the country's latest \"Victims of crime survey,\" 57% of respondents felt that housebreaking/burglary was the crime most feared in their area of residence. In recent years, South Africa has stepped up efforts to tackle crime, one of the country's worst social ills. Last September, the South African Police Service said that serious crime in the country had been reduced by 31.8% from 2004/5 to 2011/12. But 2011 to 2012 saw a reduction in serious crime of just 1.9%. \"We only have the official crime statistics to go by,\" says Rudolph Zinn of the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa. \"If you look at what the police would report annually in September of every year, we see over the last three or four years that crime has leveled off. \"The more concerning factor is the high percentage of so-called violent or contact crime, which is about a third of all the crime reported to the South African Police Service.\" And that's what has fueled the boom in the country's private security industry, crime experts say. There are nearly 9,000 companies and 400,000 registered active private security guards. That's more than the police and army combined, according to South African officials. \"The security industry is bigger than what it has ever been in South Africa,\" says Zinn. \"I think the growth in the industry is definitely attributed to the fact that, let's call it a weak policing or ineffective policing, and it created the opportunity for private individuals to move into the market.\" Some of those individuals have a military background. Waal de Waal, chief operating officer at South African-owned Protea Coin, spent 18 years in the special forces and military intelligence before joining the private security sector a decade ago. He is today one of the 17,000 people employed by Protea Coin. Part of the multi-million dollar company's work is dealing with small-scale crime, like recovering fuel stolen from a petrol station. The company, which also provides security at many of South Africa's mines and has been kept busy by the recent strikes in the sector, offers a range of services, including 24-hour property monitoring and protection against organized criminal syndicates. \"The role of private security companies is distinctively different to that of the police,\" says Petrus Van Niekerk, the chief executive of Protea Coin. \"We view our role as private security to really aid and support the police.\" But what happens when private security companies take matters into their own hands? The South African government claims that it's an industry that threatens national security and is determined to tighten its regulation. \"A very dangerous situation arises if you have a security industry that outstrips both your police and your army and there is completely no regulation of that industry,\" says Jenni Irish-Qhobosheane, the head of the Civilian Secretariat for Police. \"I think the public can find themselves in situations where, basically, they are put at the mercy of private security companies who are unprofessional,\" she adds. One measure considered by the country's government is that private security firms must be owned by South Africans. \"This type of move is going to frighten away foreign direct investment and I think that is a danger,\" says Hanes Venter, sales director at the South African arm of G4S, a London-listed global security giant. \"Foreign direct investment is already down year on year but this is a worry from that perspective for me.\" Whatever regulations the South African government eventually introduces, it seems unlikely the demand for private securities companies will diminish amid high unemployment rates, as well as widespread poverty and simmering industrial tensions.\n\nAssistant: A growing private security industry in South Africa has emerged due to high rates of violent crimes and perceived inefficiency of local police. CSS Tactical, a private security company, is one example of a firm now hired by Johannesburg residents to patrol their neighborhoods as they aim to deter crime. Recent statistics showed that in 2011 to 2012, South Africa experienced 15,609 murders, 64,514 sexual offenses, and 101,203 cases of aggravated robbery. The escalation of crime in the nation has driven the demand for private security companies.\nSouth Africa currently has nearly 9,000 security companies, with 400,000 registered active private security guards in total. This number is larger than the combined number of the police and army, according to South African officials. The government claims that this expanding industry presents a threat to national security and intends to tighten its regulation. One proposed measure is that private security firms must be owned by South Africans to limit potential manipulation by foreign entities. Although crime rates have seen a reduction in recent years, it is unlikely that the demand for private security firms will decrease due to high unemployment and poverty rates, as well as ongoing industrial tensions."}

Practice skating around for a bit by pushing off and then situating your body into the right position. The ollie is the most fundamental skateboard trick and it’s incorporated into pretty much every trick you’ll do. And the 180 is an ollie where you turn your board and body 180-degrees. For the 180 you’ll be turning around either behind you for a backside 180, or in front of you for a frontside 180. Once you have the ollie down, you’re well on your way to doing a 180 skateboard trick!  If you ride “regular” you will have your right foot in the back positioned on the tail of the board. If you ride “goofy” then your left foot will be in back on the tail. You want to position your back foot on the tip of the tail. To do a 180 on the skateboard, you’ll want to position your back foot on the corner of the tail. For a straight ollie your front foot will be centered about halfway up the board or slightly back.  You also want to put more pressure on the outer edge of your foot (the side your pinky toe is on). To help you with turning, plant your front foot so its slightly hanging over the opposite edge of board from your back foot. This may feel awkward but it will help to keep your board balanced when you’re in the air. Your shoulders and your upper body is where most of the work will come from when you perform your 180.  By setting your shoulders correctly you will be able to turn your body quickly enough and this should allow your legs and the board to follow. You might be tempted to try and force the board to turn using mostly your legs, but you won’t get enough torque this way. For a backside 180, position your front shoulder slightly in front of your chest and dip it down so when you pull up you have more momentum to work with. For a frontside 180, you want to position back shoulder in front of your chest and dip it down as well so you can pull up and create momentum. You don’t want too much of a bend so that you end up crouching too low as that won’t allow you to pop high enough. You should stand with relaxed knees like you’re getting ready to hop slightly. If you are bending correctly you should be able to slide your front forward up the board with ease.\n\nAssistant: This article explains the process of performing a 180 skateboard trick, emphasizing the importance of mastering the ollie, proper foot positioning, and using the upper body for turning momentum."}

If your horse is acting up, it can be hard to prepare the halter in the moment.  Unbuckle or unsnap the crown piece. This is the strap of the halter that goes behind the horse's ears. It should have a buckle or snap somewhere on it. Have your halter clipped to your lead line ahead of time. You want to be able to halter your horse and immediately lead him where he needs to go. You clip the lead line onto a ring at the bottom of the noseband. The noseband is the portion of a halter that slips around a horse's nose. Call your horse as you approach him. This helps alert your horse to your presence. This way, he's less likely to get spooked by your approach. Call out his name or call out something like, \"I'm coming in!\" to let him know you're entering his pasture or stall. Make sure you have your halter in your left hand as you approach. You will be haltering the horse from the left side. You want to make sure your horse knows what's happening. If you try to deceive the horse by hiding the halter, he'll learn to be distrustful of your intent. This can lead to a bad relationship between you and the horse. When haltering a horse, you should always approach from the left side. Halters are designed to be buckled on the left. You should approach your horse so you're standing near his head on the left side of his body. You do not want to put the halter on instantly. This can startle your horse. When you are a foot or so away from your horse's head, allow him to sniff your hand. This way, your horse will also familiarize himself with your scent. He'll be able to differentiate your smell from the smell of potential predators in other situations down the road. A nervous horse may benefit from having treats as a reward for staying calm.\nSummary:\n\nAssistant: 1. Prepare the halter by unbuckling or unsnapping the crown piece.\n2.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.\n\nUser: I know that the answer to the question \"When did the first Crusade end?\" is in \"The crusades were intended to seize Jerusalem from Muslim control. The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II (pope 1088–99) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) for aid against further Muslim advances. Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction. Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service.\".

To cancel out the -71 that is being subtracted from -6c, we'll add 71 to both sides of the equation.\n-47 + 71 = -6c - 71 + 71\nStep 2: Simplify both sides.\nNow, simplify by doing the math on both sides of the equation:\n24 = -6c\nStep 3: Divide by the coefficient of c.\nWe want to isolate c by itself, so we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of c, which is -6:\n24 / -6 = -6c / -6\nStep 4: Simplify to solve for c.\nNow we can simplify the equation to find the value of c:\n-4 = c\nSo the solution to the equation -47 = -6c - 71 is c = -4."}

Nor did the researchers have data on students' eating habits, or their weight or health status.\n\"This is looking at one point in time,\" said D'Angelo. \"I can't say one thing causes another. However, there's still an association here.\"\nShe noted that since the study only looked at fast food chains, the number of restaurants serving unhealthy food in the areas studied could be even higher.\nD'Angelo and her co-authors argue that while licensing or zoning policies could restrict students' exposure to tobacco and unhealthy foods, more research on neighborhood disparities is needed in order to change public policy.\n\"Food and tobacco habits begin at a young age, and habits tend to consolidate and 'stick' or 'track' over time,\" said Steven H. Kelder, an epidemiologist who was not involved with the study.\nKelder, who co-directs the Michael and Susan Dell Center for Healthy Living at the University of Texas School of Public Health in Austin, told Reuters Health by email that studies like this one provide information on how to address growing health disparities based on race and income and could point to the need for tighter restrictions at the point of sale, or counter-marketing to students of color.\n\"In this country we have a history of commercially taking advantage of poor, less educated, and vulnerable populations,\" Kelder said. \"Documenting health disparities highlights the need to address uncovered problems.\"\nWhat are the most important parts of this news article?\n\nAssistant: 1. Schools with higher numbers of Hispanic, black, and low-income students are more likely to have tobacco retailers and fast-food restaurants nearby, according to researchers.\n2. More than 50% of schools with a majority of Hispanic students were within 800 meters of both a tobacco outlet and a fast-food outlet, while 21% of schools with a majority of white students were within the same proximity of both.\n3. The study highlights the increased accessibility of tobacco and fast food for older students and suggests that retailers may be taking advantage of their purchasing power.\n4. The researchers argue that licensing or zoning policies could restrict students' exposure to tobacco and unhealthy foods, but more research on neighborhood disparities is needed to change public policy.\n5.

Answer: single cell\n\nAssistant: I used the definition of a battery, which is a device that converts stored chemical energy into electrical energy through an electrochemical reaction. Knowing this definition, I deduced that the simplest type of battery would have the least amount of components, which in this case, is a single cell.\nA single cell battery contains one electrochemical cell, which consists of a cathode, an anode, and an electrolyte. The chemical reactions at the electrodes create a flow of electrical charge. The single cell battery is considered the simplest type because it only involves one electrochemical cell carrying out the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy, whereas more complex batteries contain multiple cells connected together in series or parallel configurations to provide increased voltage or current capacity.\nIn summary, I used the definition of a battery to determine that the simplest type of battery would have the least number of components and processes involved, which led me to the answer that the simplest type of battery contains a single cell."}

Title: Escape into her world! Review: Jemima JThis beach read was a true \"thoughtless\" pleasure for me to turn the pages of. Jemima J is not the most realistic character in the world, as she looses a massive amount of weight in a short period of time, but Jemima is someone whom everyone can identify with. Jemima longs for a man, for whom she feels she can not have (Ben Williams) because of her outward appearance. Jemima is a writer in a small paper that has dreams of becoming something else. Jemima meets a man, whose outward appearance is what she dreams of, but inside may not be what she needs. Jemima has a great friend (Geraldine) who is a 100% supportive fabulous friend, but Jemima is so very envious of what Geraldine looks like. Everywoman struggles with all of these things.This writer did not seem to intend to make this a book you had to ponder though, but intended this book to be an easy read. I loved it! This book took me away from my present and let me escape into the world of Jemima!\nThe answer to this question is:\n\nAssistant: The customer was satisfied. \nMy justification for this answer is based on the sentiments expressed in the review. The customer described the book as a \"thoughtless pleasure,\" and a \"beach read,\" which are both positive terms. The customer also expressed appreciation for the book's content, including the character development and the relatability of the protagonist. Further, the last line - \"I loved it! This book took me away from my present and let me escape into the world of Jemima!\" - indicates the reviewer's enjoyment and satisfaction with the book. While there are some elements mentioned that could be perceived as negative, such as the unrealistic weight loss of the main character, they did not seem to reduce the customer's overall enjoyment of the book. Hence, the reviewer can be considered to be satisfied with the product."}

{"text": "System: You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.\n\nUser: Why can't girls stand & pee?\nHow difficult is it for women to pee standing up?\nDo those questions have the same meaning?\nOptions are: -- no. -- yes.\n\nAssistant: No, the two questions do not have the exact same meaning, although they are closely related. The first question specifically asks why girls cannot stand and pee, while the second question explores the level of difficulty women encounter when attempting to pee standing up.\nTo address the first question, girls cannot stand and pee primarily due to their anatomical differences from males. Female urinary anatomy consists of a shorter urethra and a more internal urethral opening. The urethra, which is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body, is directed downward and forward in females, making it more challenging to aim the urine stream away from the body. Moreover, the female urethra has a wider opening and is closer to the vagina, which adds to the difficulty of controlling the flow and direction of the urine stream.\nNow, let's discuss the second question. It is difficult, but not impossible, for women to pee standing up. To do so, they would need to utilize specific techniques and sometimes even special equipment. A woman must spread her legs wide, use her fingers to separate the labia, and adjust her body position to achieve the desired angle for the urine to flow away from her body. For most women, this method does not come naturally and may require practice to achieve the desired outcome without causing mess or discomfort.\nThere are devices known as female urination devices (FUDs) or \"pee funnels\" available that enable women to urinate while standing. These devices are designed to fit over the female genital area and channel the urine stream away from the body. When used correctly, FUDs can be a convenient and hygienic solution for women who prefer or need to urinate while standing up. Some women opt to use them for outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, or in situations where cleanliness of public restrooms is a concern. These devices could make it easier for women to pee standing up, although using them may still require practice and some level of dexterity.\nIn summary, the two questions presented - the inability of girls to stand and pee and the challenges faced by women in doing so – are closely related but not exactly the same. While anatomical differences make it inherently more difficult for women to urinate standing up, it is not impossible for them to do so, especially if they utilize specific techniques or opt for female urination devices."}

Title: Saturn 3 Movie plot: In the distant future, an overcrowded Earth relies on research conducted by scientists in remote stations across the solar system. One of these, a small experimental hydroponics research station on Saturn's third moon, is run solely by Adam (Douglas) and his colleague and lover Alex (Fawcett). Adam, the younger Alex and their dog Sally enjoy their isolation, far from an overcrowded and troubled Earth. The couple have been on Saturn 3 for three years, but Alex has spent all her life in space. Alex and Adam's idyll is broken by the arrival of Captain Benson (Keitel), who has been sent to Saturn 3 as part of a project to replace at least one of the moon's scientists with a robot. Benson assembles the robot and names him Hector. One of the first of its kind, a \"Demigod Series\", Hector relies on \"pure brain tissue\" extracted from human fetuses and programmed using a direct link to Benson's brain. Benson states that it will render one of the crew \"obsolete\", most likely Major Adam who tells his partner that he is close to \"abort time\" according to the government on Earth. Unknown to both Alex and Adam, Benson is a homicidal sociopath who murdered the captain originally assigned to Saturn 3 and took his place on the mission. Benson had actually failed a crucial test of psychological stability. As Benson uses the link to his brain to program the robot, Hector acquires Benson's homicidal nature and his lust for Alex. Hector initially kills Sally the dog and then assaults Benson, having learned about Benson being a murderer during the reprogramming process. Adam and Alex manage to disable the robot while it is recharging. Believing the danger over, Adam accuses Benson of gross incompetence and orders him to dismantle the robot and return to Earth when an eclipse ends. Benson obliges, but Hector is soon reassembled by the base's older robots. Resuscitated, Hector murders Benson while he is dragging Alex to his ship. Hector then blows up Benson's spacecraft before Adam and Alex can escape in it, trapping them all on...\nAnswer:\n\nAssistant: Saturn 3"}

Availability: Clothespins and paperclips are more commonly found in households and offices than needle and thread, making them more accessible.\n2. Ease of use: Clothespins and paperclips can be easily clipped onto the folded or rolled edge of the chip bag, effectively sealing it.\n3. Reusability: Both clothespins and paperclips can be reused multiple times on different bags or for other purposes.\n4. Time and effort: Using clothespins or paperclips is a quick and easy process that requires minimal time and effort.\nOption 2 - Use a needle and thread:\n1. Availability: Needle and thread may not be readily available in all households, and using it for closing a chip bag can be seen as a less practical option.\n2. Ease of use: Using a needle and thread involves threading the needle, puncturing the bag, and sewing it closed. This may leave tiny holes in the bag and has a higher chance of spilling the chips.\n3. Reusability: While needle and thread can be reused, the process of opening and closing the bag each time can be tedious.\n4. Time and effort: Using a needle and thread requires more time and effort than simply clipping something onto the bag.\nBased on this comparison, it makes more sense to accomplish the goal of keeping a bag of chips closed without bag clips by using clothespins or paperclips. They are more accessible, easier to use, reusable, and require less time and effort than using a needle and thread."}

If Roy Hodgson had said he wanted to give Adam Lallana the chance to build on his eye-catching efforts against San Marino, we would have been none the wiser about Raheem Sterling’s fatigue. Every word the England manager says is scrutinised. I can see where Hodgson was coming from but an issue has been created that both men could have done without. Had Hodgson explained he wanted to use Sterling for an impact – which he had, by winning the decisive free-kick against Estonia – there would be no quarrel. Now, though, Sterling is in the spotlight and contending with questions such as ‘how can a 19-year-old be tired?’ but those who believe he has made a mistake saying he wasn’t in the right condition to play for England are not looking at the full picture. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson reveal Raheem Sterling was too tired to start. England's Raheem Sterling looks quite relaxed on the substitutes' bench during the first half against Estonia. Jordan Henderson makes way for Sterling in the 64th minute in Tallinn as England went on to beat Estonia 1-0. Sterling told England manager Roy Hodgson that he was not 100 per cent and that he was too tired to start. Of the players England used against Estonia, only Gary Cahill has played more minutes this season than Raheem Sterling. 1164 - Gary Cahill. 1079 - Raheem Sterling. 1064 - Jack Wilshere. 1035 - Jordan Henderson. 995 - Calum Chambers. 990 - Joe Hart. 990 - Leighton Baines. 919 - Phil Jagielka. 836 - Danny Welbeck. 758 - Wayne Rooney. 741 - Fabian Delph. 538 - Adam Lallana. It doesn’t matter whether you are 19 or 29, if you play nine games in a month, like Raheem did in September, it will leave a mark on you physically. So, in some respects, he has been brave to confront the issue and explain his concerns to Hodgson. Would I have ever done it? No. I feared if I missed a game, someone would come in and take my place. I also never wanted to give managers an excuse to leave me out, so there were times when I played in games I shouldn’t have done. Was it the right thing to do? No. Injuries are what I would mask but I remember a game at Bolton in September 2006 when I was shattered, having been to the World Cup in Germany. We lost 2-0, one of the goals came from a cross into the box. I tried to jump for a header but had nothing in my legs. Had I been right, I know I would have got my head to the ball first. As a central defender, you can find a way of getting through a game, you don’t have to operate at the rapier pace that Raheem moves with. His game is based around high intensity sprinting and he needs sharpness to go past opponents, with or without the ball. The England substitutes watch on as 19-year-old Sterling (second right) was rested from the starting line-up. 32 - Jagielka, Lambert. 29 - Baines. 28 - Rooney, Cahill. 27 - Hart. 26 - Lallana. 24 - Henderson, Delph. 23 - Welbeck. 22 - Wilshere. 21 - Oxlade-Chamberlain. 19 - Chambers, Sterling. We want Raheem to thrill us, to be an exciting figure for many years to come. We don’t want him to get to 25 and his best form be a thing of the past. If he is managed properly now and looks after himself, he won’t suffer burn out like another former Liverpool and England teenage prodigy. A few weeks ago, I spent some time with Sir Alex Ferguson. During our conversation, he remembered how, in 1997, Michael Owen and I had played at the Under-20 World Cup in Malaysia. Michael came back and went straight into Liverpool’s first team at the start of the season. By contrast, the United players in that England squad – Ronnie Wallwork and John Curtis – were both given a month off to recover but Michael was on a rapid upward curve and at the end of that campaign, he set the World Cup finals in France alight. Michael wanted to play in every game for club and country but, in October 1998, Gerard Houllier and Roy Evans – in their brief reign as Liverpool’s joint managers – decided to rest him for a UEFA Cup game against Valencia. Michael wasn’t happy and said in an interview “I’ll rest when I’m 40”. Former  Liverpool and Englad striker Michael Owen wanted to play every game for club and country. Sterling told Hodgson he was feeling tired and not in the right mental state during training on Saturday evening. VIDEO Sterling defends England tiredness. That comment went down well with supporters and ex-players but was he right? No. Michael played far too much for Liverpool and England too early, never getting a summer off to recharge physically or mentally. Was it a coincidence that he suffered a serious hamstring injury in April 1999? Raheem is becoming like Michael, with stature and his pace and his importance to club and country at such an early stage of his career but there have been signs over the last few weeks that such a punishing spell is beginning to catch up with him. He may have only played two games at the World Cup but Sterling was training every day in stifling conditions, having just come off a season in which he had been a key figure in Liverpool’s title charge. After three weeks off, he then went to the USA for Liverpool’s pre-season tour. Don’t underestimate what an impact that schedule will have had on him, physically and mentally. Figures back that up. Between May 30, 2013 and October 13, 2013, Raheem had played 615 minutes of football. In the same period this year, that figure had shot up to 1682 minutes. Sterling may have only started two games at the 2014 World Cup but the England winger was in training daily. Sterling came on in the 64th minute but still received criticism from those on Twitter for his decision. Sterling, warming up during the first half, complained of feeling tired in training ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier. Hodgson and Brendan Rodgers will talk about how to handle him going forward but, naturally, they are going to want to use him when they can as he is a match-winner. That’s why he played against Middlesbrough in the League Cup. Liverpool’s poor start in the league meant Rodgers needed his quality. Liverpool could not have afforded to be on the end of a giant-killing that night, so the plan would have been to get the game won and get Sterling off early. As it was, things never went to plan and he subjected to 120 minutes. Since then, his performances have been notably lacking sparkle. Sterling retweeted those criticising him online before writing: 'Now listening to... Excuse me for being human' His importance at Anfield is vital and that is why, at the end of last season, Rodgers called him “the best young player in Europe”.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps.\n\nUser: By. Thomas Burrows for MailOnline. Cameraman Huw Walters allegedly forged his wife's signature to pay off £59,000 in debts. He denies three counts of fraud at Cardiff Crown Court. An award-winning cameraman forged his wife's signature to pay off £59,000 in debts, before divorcing her, a court heard. Huw Talfryn Walters, 50, allegedly spent the money on buying expensive camera and photographic equipment. But the court heard the freelance cameraman kept his spiralling money problems secret from his wife, Helen Bowen. The case was brought before a new jury after the original jury failed to reach a majority verdict in March this year. Cardiff Crown Court heard yesterday how Walters forged Miss Bowen's signature three times to take £59,000 from their joint mortgage on their marital home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff. During one application, he wrote: 'We need these funds urgently, so your speed in these matters would be welcome.' He then ended their 14-year marriage after telling his wife he needed to put their house up for sale. Walters allegedly told Miss Bowers: 'I'm divorcing you because if I don't I'm going to go bankrupt.' Prosecutor John Davies said: 'Miss Bowen made a career change around 2005 and after that left the mortgage and bills to her husband who she trusted. 'They separated in December 2011 and not long after that she became aware the mortgage had increased without her agreement. 'She contacted the bank to obtain copies of the three withdrawals which increased the size of the mortgage by £59,000. 'She realised the signatures on them didn't belong to her - they were written by her husband without her knowledge while they still lived together.' Freelance cameraman Walters has worked on programmes including the BBC Proms, Doctor Who and Channel 4's history show Time Team. He has won two Welsh Baftas for his cinematography and camera work in recent years. The court heard Walters spent thousands of pounds on expensive camera equipment. Mr. Davies told the jury: 'A total of £59,000 was acquired using the fake. signature of his then wife. He entered each signature having not. consulted her or asked to consent.' Scroll down for video. Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) heard how Walters forged Miss Bowen's signature three times to take £59,000 from their joint mortgage on their marital home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff. The court heard from a forensic handwriting expert, who proved Helen Bowen's signature had not been written by her - and was most likely written by her husband. Miss Bowers, a professional reflexologist, said she only discovered her husband had forged her signature a few months after their separation - when she was contacted by her mortgage provider. When asked if she agreed to the mortgage withdrawals, she replied: 'No, not at all. If I had been asked I would not have agreed to them.' Walters, now of Maesteg, in Bridgend, denies three charges of fraud. The trial continues.

You must generate a detailed and long answer.\n\nUser: How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet?\n@clairemsp tians alot\n\nAssistant: To provide an in-depth description of the sentiment of the tweet \"@clairemsp tians alot\", one needs to first dissect and analyze the various elements present in it. There are a few important assumptions we have to make in order to analyze the tweet, as the text has some errors and is therefore open to interpretation. \n1. Context: It is crucial to consider the context surrounding the tweet, such as the subject matter, any previous conversation, the Twitter user's profile, and recent related events. A sentiment analysis based solely on the text may provide a skewed or misleading interpretation.\n2. Text interpretation: Taking the given tweet at face value, it appears to contain a typing error. We can assume that the correct version could be \"@clairemsp means alot\" or \"@clairemsp thanks a lot\", with the latter being a more plausible interpretation as 'tians' could possibly be a misspelled or typo version of 'thanks'. This interpretation suggests a message of gratitude. Semantically, this phrase signifies a positive sentiment.\n3. User's Tone: Analyzing the specific tweet, we can observe that the user is directly addressing \"clairemsp\" and sharing that something \"means a lot\" or they are thankful. This could imply that clairemsp has contributed to something valuable or helpful; however, the tweet lacks specific details. Despite that, overall, the tone of the tweet appears to be appreciative and possibly positive.\nConsidering these elements, the sentiment of the tweet can be described as predominantly positive. Here, the author is expressing gratitude to the person they've mentioned in the tweet and is likely appreciative of their help, contribution, or impact. It is essential to note that understanding the broader context and tone of the conversation or topic would provide better insight and accuracy in determining the tweet sentiment. However, based on the available information, it can be concluded that the sentiment expressed in this tweet appears to be positive."}

It is named after Giuseppe Vitali and Constantin Carathéodory.\nHypothesis: Vitali–Carathéodory theorem involves mathematics\n\nAssistant: After reading the paragraph provided, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is true. The Vitali–Carathéodory theorem involves mathematics, particularly in the field of real analysis. Real analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of real numbers, their properties, and the properties of functions and sequences defined on the set of real numbers.\nThe theorem is named after Giuseppe Vitali and Constantin Carathéodory, two mathematicians who studied and made significant contributions to this area of mathematics. The theorem states that under certain conditions, integrable functions (i.e., functions whose integrals or areas under the curve exist) can be approximated in the L space (a function space in mathematics that deals with the study of certain types of functions; specifically, functions that are measurable and have finite norms) from above and below by lower- and upper-semicontinuous functions, respectively.\nLower-semicontinuous functions are functions that have the property that the limit inferior (or greatest lower bound) of the function at a point is less than or equal to the value of the function at that point. Upper-semicontinuous functions, on the other hand, have the property that the limit superior (or least upper bound) of the function at a point is greater than or equal to the value of the function at that point.\nIn summary, the Vitali–Carathéodory theorem is an important result in mathematics dealing with the properties of integrable functions, their approximations using lower- and upper-semicontinuous functions, and their applications to the study of real numbers and real-valued functions. As such, the hypothesis is true: the theorem is indeed a part of mathematics."}

Mary could still remember the day when Tanya revealed her true colors, leaving her in utter shock. The first step in moving forward was for Mary to fully grasp the situation and come to terms with the fact that Tanya was not the person she thought she knew.\nStep 1: Acceptance\nIn order to heal, Mary had to accept that Tanya was a completely different person from the loyal friend she had trusted for so long. It was challenging as she went over the countless memories they had shared, wondering if Tanya had been pretending the entire time. The process of acceptance was slow and difficult, but it was essential in order for Mary to let go and find closure.\nStep 2: Emotional Expression\nMary found it crucial to express and release the hurt, anger, and sadness that she felt as a result of Tanya's actions. She chose to write in a journal, where she could vent her feelings honestly and privately, without the fear of judgment from others. This outlet allowed her to process her emotions and gain a clearer understanding of her thoughts and experiences.\nStep 3: Seeking Support\nAs Mary worked through her feelings, she reached out to her friends and family for support. They provided her with the much-needed love, encouragement, and a sense of belonging as she faced her challenging emotional journey. Their presence acted as a reminder that despite the loss of one friendship, she still had others who cared for her deeply.\nStep 4: Forgiveness\nAlthough it took a considerable amount of time, Mary eventually reached a point where she was able to forgive Tanya. Forgiveness didn't mean that she condoned Tanya's actions, but rather, she let go of the resentment and negative emotions she had been holding onto. Forgiving Tanya allowed Mary to free herself from the hold that the betrayal had on her life, and in turn, regain her emotional well-being.\nStep 5: Moving Forward\nWith forgiveness achieved, Mary began to rebuild her life without Tanya. She focused on strengthening her relationships with her existing support network, and even forged new connections along the way. While the betrayal was painful, it ultimately pushed Mary towards personal growth and lessons that she would carry with her throughout her life.\nIn the end, the long and intertwining road towards healing taught Mary several valuable lessons about trust, friendship, and resilience. As she closed the chapter on her fallout with Tanya, Mary emerged stronger and more self-aware, ready to embrace new experiences and authentic connections with those who truly deserved her trust."}

The move would enable Google to produce its own smartwatches. It already develops a version of Android for wearables. Fitbit's share price increased by 19% before being suspended. Google has not commented. A spokeswoman for Fitbit said it \"does not comment on rumours or speculation\". Reuters did not say what sum had been offered. It emerged in September that Fitbit, currently valued by the markets at around $1.4bn (£1.1bn) after Monday's surge, was touting itself for a sale. Fitbit, which in its latest quarterly earnings posted a loss of $68.5m, is looking precarious as a standalone entity since bigger firms have gained a strong footing in wearable technology. \"A key tipping point is likely to have been Apple's decision to price its Series 3 Apple Watch at $199/£199,\" said Leo Gebbie, from the consultancy CCS Insight. \"That will have put immense pressure on Fitbit's own products, which are already feeling the challenge from low-cost rivals such as [China's] Xiaomi.\" In an attempt to diversify its income, Fitbit has expanded into other areas - including monitoring users' breathing during sleep, and diabetes management. But the firm trails Huawei, Apple and Xiaomi in fitness tech sales. For Google the deal, if confirmed, would represent a renewed effort to develop its Wear OS platform. \"Although Google has been lukewarm in its commitment to wearables recently, this indicates it is serious about the segment and could provide a strong boost to its ambitions,\" Mr Gebbie added. CCS Insight predicted 142 million wearable devices would be sold worldwide this year, at a value of $17.1bn. Meanwhile, Google's parent company Alphabet released its third quarter results which showed a drop in net profit to $7bn in the three months to 30 September. Analysts had been expecting profit of $8.8bn. It fell from $9bn in same period last year when changes to US tax law had boosted Alphabet's bottom line.

To do this, add 43*o to both sides to eliminate the -43*o term from the right side:\n(-40*o + 43*o) + 63 = -43*o + 43*o\n3*o + 63 = 0\nStep 3: Isolate the variable by moving the constant term to the other side.\nSubtract 63 from both sides to isolate the 3*o term:\n3*o + 63 - 63 = 0 - 63\n3*o = -63\nStep 4: Solve for the variable.\nDivide both sides by 3 to find the value of o:\n3*o / 3 = -63 / 3\no = -21\nThe solution is o = -21."}

You must generate a detailed and long answer.\n\nUser: Do these sentences have the same meaning?\nThe researchers found only empty cavities and scar tissue where the tumors had been .\nNo tumors were detected ; rather , empty cavities and scar tissue were found in their place .\n\nAssistant: Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, although they are structured differently and use somewhat different phrasing. Let's break down the meaning of each sentence to better understand their similarities.\nSentence 1: \"The researchers found only empty cavities and scar tissue where the tumors had been.\"\nIn this sentence, the focus is on what the researchers found in the location where tumors previously existed. The use of \"only\" emphasizes that instead of finding any tumors, the researchers discovered \"empty cavities and scar tissue.\" This implies that the tumors are no longer present, and what remains in their place is the aftermath of their removal or disappearance (i.e., the empty cavities and scar tissue).\nSentence 2: \"No tumors were detected; rather, empty cavities and scar tissue were found in their place.\"\nThis sentence is more explicit about the absence of tumors. The first phrase, \"No tumors were detected,\" clearly states that the researchers did not find any tumors. The second part of the sentence, following the semicolon, elaborates on this finding by using the word \"rather\" to indicate that instead of tumors, they found \"empty cavities and scar tissue\" in the location where tumors would be expected. This also implies that the tumors are no longer there and have been replaced by these empty cavities and scar tissue.\nBoth sentences express the idea that the researchers were looking for tumors but discovered empty cavities and scar tissue instead. Consequently, the two sentences convey the same meaning, even though they use different wording and structure."}

{"text": "System: You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps.\n\nUser: By. Sam Greenhill. and Daniel Martin. Created:. 19:52 EST, 20 February 2012. Jobless people attending courses run by David Cameron's 'back to work' tsar  Emma Harrison were ordered to sign blank timesheets, it was alleged yesterday. Others complained of being forced to waste hours sitting doing nothing instead  of being allowed to look for gainful employment. A damning dossier of allegations about Mrs Harrison's employment agency A4e has been handed to the Comptroller and Auditor General by former minister Fiona  Mactaggart. She is the Labour MP for Slough, Berkshire, where last week A4e's offices were  visited by police as part of a fraud probe. The Prime Minister is facing demands to suspend lucrative Whitehall contracts  which A4e won to help the long-term unemployed find jobs. 'Posh commune': A4e boss Mrs Harrison's £5million pile has 16 bedrooms, 100 acres of land, a pool, spa, a bar, a nightclub and a long dining table for banquets. Millionairess Mrs Harrison, 48 - made. families tsar by Mr Cameron after she  boasted she could help problem. families find work - triggered outrage when she  paid herself. £8.6million of mainly taxpayers' cash. Ministers. have sought urgent reassurance there is no 'systematic fraud' of the. public purse, after Thames Valley Police were called in by the. Department of  Work and Pensions. Ms. Mactaggart's dossier contains accusations from constituents who were. made to  attend an A4e 'back to work' course as a condition of receiving. state benefits. One claimed: 'Every Friday, the \"clients\" have to sign a blank timesheet and  the times are filled in later. 'Members of my group were told to fill in a blank piece of paper outlining any  \"modules\"...and to sign a blank \"review\". 'I would guess this was to fraudulently claim that all \"criteria\" as laid down  by the government was adhered to.' Another. complainant, a construction worker, said he had spent 13 weeks on an. A4e course supposedly to renew a forklift operator's licence yet had. 'received  no training at all', despite repeatedly asking for some. Attendance. on a back-to-work course is mandatory for the long-term unemployed  if. they want to keep being paid benefits, and companies such as A4e charge. taxpayers millions of pounds to run them. But a third person described a 'chaotic, unorganised' A4e course in which 'we  would mostly be shunted in and out of rooms, staring at walls, long silences  with none of the staff telling the group what was happening'. She told the MP her group was forced to 'learn' menial tasks such as how to  write a letter on a computer. She said: 'I did not learn anything that I did  not know already, and it is ridiculous and worrying that people like myself  should be forced into this position where I have a proven work history.' Last night Ms Mactaggart, a former Home Office minister and a member of the  influential Public Accounts Committee, said: 'I think there is a series of what  appears to me on the face of it to be fraudulent actions - expecting people to  sign blank time sheets and so on. Prime Minister David Cameron is facing calls to sack his 'back to work' tsar after a fraud probe was launched. 'It is in itself wrong to get vulnerable unemployed people to sign blank time  sheets, because this company is in the position where it has the power to put  people in breach of their Jobseekers' Allowance conditions. 'In my view, that makes A4e not fit to receive a government contract. The  government should absolutely consider suspending the contracts. 'The concerns that my constituents have raised are sufficient for me to believe  that they are not a proper company to get taxpayers' money and to be dealing  with vulnerable people.' The MP forwarded the complaints to Sir Amyas Morse, the Comptroller and Auditor  General - the head of the National Audit Office which scrutinises the accounts  of government departments and agencies. She demanded an investigation, telling him the cases seemed to be examples of  'A4e taking money from the Government without actually delivering anything  worthwhile'. Other MPs have attacked Mrs Harrison's vast dividend, which she paid herself  after A4e recorded a £234million turnover. A4e - which used to be called Action  For Employment - makes all its UK income from state contracts. Mrs Harrison, worth an estimated £70million, lives in a £7million country  mansion in Derbyshire with her husband Jim, their four children, and a group of  11 close friends and their six children in a 'posh commune'. Labour's Margaret Hodge, who is chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, has led calls for Mrs Harrison's company to have its state contracts suspended. Margaret Hodge, the chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, yesterday  tabled a parliamentary question asking whether the Government would suspend the  company's contracts pending inquiries. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'Officers visited the offices of A4e in  Slough as part of an allegation of fraud, which was referred to the Force by  the Department for Work and Pensions. The investigation is ongoing and at an  early stage, therefore we are currently unable to comment any further.' A4e said the police had only come in 'for a meeting' and had not taken away any  documents. It said the fraud probe concerned an isolated incident two years ago  relating to four employees who had since left the company, and that A4e had discovered the alleged fraud itself and reported it to the Department for Work  and Pensions within 48 hours. Last night an A4e spokesman insisted the concerns raised by Ms Mactaggart had  been resolved, saying: 'Under the new Work Programme, customers are no longer  required to fill out timesheets. 'All our staff have clear guidelines on how to complete claims made under Work  Programme and these claims are independently verified by the employer and by  JobCentre Plus. 'A4e has a zero tolerance policy towards any form of behaviour that might lead  to allegations of fraud. 'The concerns raised by Fiona Mactaggart's constituents are not linked to the  current Thames Valley Police investigation.'\nHere is a summary of the highlights for this article:\n\nAssistant: - David Cameron's 'back to work' tsar Emma Harrison's employment agency A4e has been accused of ordering jobless people to sign blank timesheets.\n- Former minister Fiona Mactaggart has handed a damning dossier of allegations about A4e to the Comptroller and Auditor General.\n- A4e's offices in Slough were visited by police as part of a fraud probe.\n- The Prime Minister is facing demands to suspend lucrative Whitehall contracts awarded to A4e.\n- A4e has denied any systematic fraud, and claims that the police visit was for a meeting, not to seize documents.\n- Emma Harrison has previously faced controversy for paying herself £8.6 million in taxpayer-funded dividends."}

{"text": "System: User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer.\n\nUser: Teacher:In this task you will be given a list of dictionaries. A dictionary is a set of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and has a value associated with that key. You should sort the list of dictionaries from smallest to largest by their 'first' key. If there is two dictionaries with the same 'first' value then sort them by their 'second' key. Negative numbers should come before positive numbers.\nTeacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: [{'first': 12, 'second': 17}, {'first': -88, 'second': 99}, {'first': -90, 'second': -3}, {'first': 64, 'second': -24}, {'first': -23, 'second': -4}, {'first': -6, 'second': -62}, {'first': 2, 'second': 0}]\nStudent:\n\nAssistant: First, we need to sort the dictionaries by their 'first' key value. We will use the built-in Python 'sorted' function which provides a way to sort elements by providing a function to compute a sort key from an element. In this case, the key function will be a lambda that extracts the 'first' key value from the dictionary.\nSecond, in case where two dictionaries have the same 'first' value, they should be sorted by 'second' key. The 'sorted' function provides a way to specify multiple sort keys by returning a tuple from the key function. Python will sort the tuples primarily by the first element, then the second element in case of ties, and so on.\nLet's solve:\ninput = [{'first': 12, 'second': 17}, {'first': -88, 'second': 99}, {'first': -90, 'second': -3}, {'first': 64, 'second': -24}, {'first': -23, 'second': -4}, {'first': -6, 'second': -62}, {'first': 2, 'second': 0}]\nWe will use the 'sorted' function with key function that returns tuple with 'first' and 'second' values of dictionary:\nresult = sorted(input, key=lambda d: (d['first'], d['second']))\nThe result should be the list sorted by 'first' key from smallest to largest, and by 'second' key in case of same 'first' values:\n[{'first': -90, 'second': -3}, {'first': -88, 'second': 99}, {'first': -23, 'second': -4}, {'first': -6, 'second': -62}, {'first': 2, 'second': 0}, {'first': 12, 'second': 17}, {'first': 64, 'second': -24}] \nThis result list satisfies all the conditions provided in the task - dictionaries with smaller 'first' key come before ones with larger 'first' key, and in case of a tie the 'second' key is used for ordering. Also, negative values come before positive ones."}

I have always been greeted immediately and have never had to wait more than a couple minutes before I am taken back for services. It truly has been my go-to in the past and I am super sad that I am going to stop frequenting this business.

Usually I am in and out in a couple minutes with perfectly manicured brows. This time I left with my eyebrows on FIRE. I went to the Albertson's following my appointment and bought some cooling aloe gel for relief but nothing helped. The area ended up breaking out in blisters that last at least a week. I had several people ask me if I had suffered a burn. Yikes! it was not good and extremely painful.   I let the bad eyebrow wax slide and thought maybe it was a fluke accident and went back last night for a mani-pedi. I feel bad because I am not sure the tech who was working on me really understood some of the things I was trying to communicate to her. At one point I asked her to file my nails slightly shorter and she said \"ok\" but then just moved on. That wasn't really the worst part though. During both the mani and pedi she repeatedly hurt me while removing my cuticles. I can be a wuss so I know sometimes it is just me being a baby but this was ridiculous. At one point I gasped and pulled my foot away and the nail tech next to her actually had to scold her and tell her to take it easy.

I was simply awed by the writing of Mr Hall, and the universal human truths he reminds the reader of. I can see that more than a few writers must have read Oakley Hall's novels, most especially Cormac Mccarthy. Warlock was published in 1958, and Badlands was at least 10 yrs later, followed by Apaches, which was at least another decade later.

On just the fourth overall play of the game, Safety Steve Gleason blocked a punt and DB Curtis Deloatch managed to land on the ball in the end zone for the Saints first score of the game.  Former Saints kicker Morten Andersen helped Atlanta get its only score of the game, from a 26-yard field goal.  From there, the Saints dominated the rest of the game.  For the final score of the first quarter, WR Devery Henderson ran 11 yards for a touchdown on a reverse.  Kicker John Carney would provide the scoring for the rest of the game, as he kicked two second-quarter field goals (a 37-yarder and a 51-yarder), and one third-quarter field goal (a 20-yarder) to essentially wrap up the game.  From there, the Saints defense continued to put pressure on Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, as they sacked him five times, while limiting the running duo of Vick and Dunn to just a combined total of 101 rushing yards.  With their dominating performance, the Saints would take the lead in the NFC South with a surprising 3-0 record. Green Day and U2 performed jointly on the field before the game, while the Goo Goo Dolls held a concert outside the Dome earlier in the evening.\nAnswer this question based on the article: How many yards did Morten Anderson kick?\n\nAssistant: Based on the article, former Saints kicker Morten Andersen helped Atlanta get its only score of the game from a 26-yard field goal."}

The film explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, power struggles, and the blurred lines between the worlds of law enforcement and organized crime.\nNew World has been praised for its gripping narrative, evocative cinematography, and exceptional performances, especially those of Lee Jung-jae and Hwang Jung-min. The film's portrayal of the intricate and often treacherous relationships between the main characters contributes to its complex exploration of the eternal conflict between the police and mob organizations.\nIn summary, the film noir \"New World\" starring Lee Jung-jae captures the conflict between the police and the mob through its powerful storytelling and engaging characters, offering a poignant and insightful look into the murky world of organized crime in South Korea."}

Having been a senator since 1977, Hatch is the longest-serving Republican Senator in U.S. history. Hatch served as either the chair or ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1993 to 2005. He previously served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987 and currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee as well as serving on the board of directors for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\nHatch introduced the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act, narrowing the broad authority of the DEA to suspend drug \"manufacturers, distributors, and dispensers\". Hatch stated the bill was also written to protect patients from disruptions in the production and delivery of their prescription drugs: \"The fact that prescription drugs can be abused should not prevent patients from receiving the medications they need. This bill takes a balanced approach to the problem of prescription drug abuse by clarifying penalties for manufacturing or dispensing outside approved procedures while helping to ensure that supply chains to legitimate users remain intact\". The bill passed the Senate unanimously and Tom Marino passed a version of the bill in the House and was signed by President Barack Obama.  Critics of the bill claim the new law fuels the opioid crisis by limiting the DEA's ability to halt production and distribution by predatory drug companies. DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge John J. Mulrooney II wrote in the Marquette Law Review: \"At a time when, by all accounts, opioid abuse, addiction and deaths were increasing markedly, this new law imposed a dramatic diminution of the agency's authority. It is now all but logically impossible for the DEA to suspend a drug company's operations for failing to comply with federal law.\" Donald Trump's Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the law \"dubious\" and joined 44 state attorneys general calling for \"repeal or amendment of the law to restore some of the DEA's authority.\" Jim Geldhof, a former DEA program manager whom spent 43 years with the DEA called the bill \"outrageous. It basically takes any kind of action DEA was going to do with a distributor or manufacturer as far as an immediate suspension off the table. And then the other part of that really infuriates me is that corrective action plan.\" Mulrooney compared the corrective action plan to one that would \"allow bank robbers to round up and return inkstained money and agree not to rob any more banks -- all before any of those wrongdoers actually admit fault and without any consequence that might deter such behavior in the future.\"  Hatch responded to a Washington Post and 60 Minutes investigation into the bill by writing a Washington Post opinion article calling the investigation \"misleading\" and asking to \"leave conspiracy theories to Netflix\". Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a co-sponsor of the senate bill, also defended the bill: \"This bill was drafted in consultation with the DEA to offer better guidance for companies working to safely and responsibly supply prescription drugs to pharmacies, and to promote better communication and certainty between companies and regulators.\"  Republican Pat Toomey Pat Toomey expressed doubts that a conspiracy existed, but still suggested amending the bill: \"I'm a little surprised that it passed unanimously in both houses, was signed by President Obama and got no opposition from the DEA at the time. That's not the way controversial legislation usually ends up, but hey, if there's problems, then we ought to revisit them.\"  Hatch received $177,000 in donations from the drug industry while pushing the bill through and has received $2,178,863 from the Pharmaceuticals/Health Products industry from 1989-2014 according to required filings by the Federal Election Commission.\nAsk a question about this article.\n\nAssistant: Orrin Hatch is a very important man in the United States government. He has been a senator, which means he helps make laws, for a very long time - since 1977! He is from the state of Utah and is a member of the Republican party. He has worked on many different committees that focus on things like health, education, and laws. He created a bill, which is like an idea for a new rule, to make sure people can get the medicine they need but also make sure those medicines are not abused. This bill became a law, but some people think it may not be the best solution and might make another problem, called the opioid crisis, worse. Orrin Hatch has also received a lot of money from companies that make medicines, which some people think might make him support rules that are good for those companies."}
