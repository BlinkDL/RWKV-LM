Practice skating around for a bit by pushing off and then situating your body into the right position. The ollie is the most fundamental skateboard trick and it’s incorporated into pretty much every trick you’ll do. And the 180 is an ollie where you turn your board and body 180-degrees. For the 180 you’ll be turning around either behind you for a backside 180, or in front of you for a frontside 180. Once you have the ollie down, you’re well on your way to doing a 180 skateboard trick!  If you ride “regular” you will have your right foot in the back positioned on the tail of the board. If you ride “goofy” then your left foot will be in back on the tail. You want to position your back foot on the tip of the tail. To do a 180 on the skateboard, you’ll want to",

You also want to put more pressure on the outer edge of your foot (the side your pinky toe is on). To help you with turning, plant your front foot so its slightly hanging over the opposite edge of board from your back foot. This may feel awkward but it will help to keep your board balanced when you’re in the air. Your shoulders and your upper body is where most of the work will come from when you perform your 180.  By setting your shoulders correctly you will be able to turn your body quickly enough and this should allow your legs and the board to follow. You might be tempted to try and force the board to turn using mostly your legs, but you won’t get enough torque this way. For a backside 180, position your front shoulder slightly in front of your chest and dip it down so when you pull up you have more momentum to work with. For a fron",
