Know What You Donâ€™t Know: Unanswerable Questions for SQuAD
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03822.pdf

Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset,
consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles,
where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the
corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.
SQuAD2.0 combines the 100,000 questions in SQuAD1.1 with over 50,000 unanswerable
questions written adversarially by crowdworkers to look similar to answerable ones.
To do well on SQuAD2.0, systems must not only answer questions when possible, but
also determine when no answer is supported by the paragraph and abstain from answering.
